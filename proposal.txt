Webprog Final Project Proposal
=============================

Project Title: Mini Game with Leaderboard
Your Name: Johannes Spilka

Description
-----------
I want to do a Webapp Minigame with a Leaderboard. 
A Player will be able to choose a Name before playing and his Name will be in the Leaderboard if he reaches a minimum Score(so far the plan). 
So it will be a minigame with guestplayer access.
Milestone(s)
------------
I want to have a working leaderboard which get displayed when a user clicks on Play (0 points for now) by the first checkpoint.
Ideally I want a minimal fuctional game working by the firts checkpoint. At least locally.
And then i want to improve the overall gameplay and Design of the Game.
If possible i would try to add also a User registration on top of the Guestplayer functionallity, so Players can create a unique Username to represent themself in the Leaderboard.

External libraries and code
I plan to use the following external tools and libraries:

-Firebase (Realtime Database or Firestore) – to store and retrieve guest scores for the leaderboard.

-JavaScript – for game logic, DOM manipulation, and API communication.

-HTML/CSS – for structuring and styling the user interface.

-No additional libraries or game engines are planned at this stage, but this may change as the project develops( i have some experience with Unity3D but i will very likely not take it this far, also because i want to stay inside the Classes topics).


Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I will consult the following resources:

-MDN Web Docs for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS reference.
-I may ask classmates or test users for feedback only on usability and gameplay during development.
(- maybe Google for Login Services: OAuth login)


Anything else?
-------------
There is yet not real explanation on the game itself since i may change it up.
