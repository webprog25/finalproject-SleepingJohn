Final Project
====================

Project Title: **Vertical Snake Game**  
Your Name: **Johannes Spilka**

Overview
--------
A fast, challenging, vertical take on the classic Snake idea. You control a single “snake” cell that can move left/right while obstacle rows descend from the top. The game ramps difficulty over time by increasing fall speed and tightening the gap you must pass through. It includes a simple leaderboard (saved locally in the browser), optional Google Sign-In to autofill your player name, and a small “Controls” popup explaining the keys and how to move.

Running
-------
Runs on any modern desktop browser.

- You can open `index.html` directly to play. 
-> For example use  `Open with Live Server` in VS.
- **Note:** Google Sign-In only works when served from an HTTP origin; it will not work from `file://`. The game itself works without sign-in—just type your name.
