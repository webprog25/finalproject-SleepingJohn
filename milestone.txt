Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Snake Game(name maybe changing)
Your Name: Johannes Spilka

Overview
--------
So far, I’ve implemented the core game structure as written in the proposal for a Snake Game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The player can input their name and start the game. 
The game displays the snake(which is just a dot for now) on a canvas and allows for basic rendering. Buttons for the leaderboard and game start screen are functional.
I still need to implement the "snake" movement, collision, and score tracking. The leaderboard currently shows a placeholder and doesn’t store or display actual scores yet.
I tried to make  green overlay in the theme of a poisenous green snake.

Project Changes
---------------
Originally I considered using a database or server for the leaderboard, but I’ll now keep it local with localStorage for simplicity .(not yet)

Implementation Details
----------------------
Frontend:
-The game uses HTML elements divided into three screens: startScreen, gameScreen, and leaderboard.

-Uers enter their name in an <input> field. On clicking "Play", their name is stored and displayed.

-A <canvas> element is used to draw the game field and snake dot.

-The snake is drawn using the CanvasRenderingContext2D API and will be moved using keyboard event listeners and a game loop (via setInterval).

-I will add buttons to restart the game after game over or stat automatically.

-Backend (local only):
No external server or API for now. Score data will be saved using window.localStorage. (later maybe mongodb)

-Data will be saved as a JSON array of score entries and shown in a list inside the leaderboardList .


External libraries and code
---------------------------
-No external libraries currently used.


Code is written entirely in JS, HTML5, and CSS3.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
MDN Web Docs (Canvas API, localStorage)

W3Schools and Stack Overflow for HTML/CSS layout tips and canvas drawing examples.

ChatGpt for some tips on CSS styling


Anything else?
--------------
The next milestone will be adding actual gameplay logic and making the leaderboard functional.

I will more likly turn into a "run throug obstacles" game cause the idea i had in mind originally might ot work as i had it in mind.
But now the plan is to have the "snake" dot run through generating obstacles with increasing speed.
